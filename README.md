## Common Commands
**Watch** (activated via command palette or shortcut icon on the status bar):
Activating watch allows the extension to keep track of coverage changes and update its cache. It also will automatically apply coverage to a file if some exists.

**Display** (activated via command palette or shortcut key):
Displays coverage for the current activated file only, does not update if the coverage files change.

**Preview Report** (activated via command palette):
Shows you a html preview of your coverage reports in your editor.

- macos, linux or windows
